FEEDBACK

Line 8 Remove my comment and include a sentence describing your function

Line 19 Give some idea what you are expecting them to enter

Line 23 Technically, -273 is still okay, but less than that is not

Line 24 I think you mean ‘Input a temperature…’

Line 38 What if they input a lowercase ‘y’? What if they don’t input either of those?
